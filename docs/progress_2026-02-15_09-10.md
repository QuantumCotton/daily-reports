### Rate Limit Issues:

- No new leads generated in the last hour
- All Treasure Coast files updated simultaneously
- San Jose file updated earlier at 06:46 UTC

### Monitoring Notes:
- System appears stable but not generating new leads
- All agent containers remain active
- No recent error logs or 429 errors detected
- Possible agents are idle or waiting for rate limits

### Recommendations:
1. Investigate why no new leads generated in past hour
2. Check if agents are stuck waiting for rate limits
3. Focus attention on San Francisco (still 0 leads)
4. Verify lead enrichment processes are running

### Time in Monitoring: 2 hours completed
