## Template 1: Property Management Company — PM Dashboard Edition

**Subject:** `[Company Name] — Your Mission Control Center Awaits`

```
Hi [First Name],

Property management is chaos. [X] properties, [Y] maintenance requests, [Z] contractors — and you're the one holding it all together.

What if you had a mission control center for all of it?

KMJK introduces Property Manager Dashboard features:

📊 **Real-Time Task Tracking**
   Every maintenance request, update, and completion logged instantly
   Track by property, category, urgency, or technician
   Filter: All → Active → Completed

🤖 **Agent Swarm Coordination**
   Automatic task assignment based on priority
   Real-time status updates (no more "is he coming today?" calls)
   Technician location tracking and ETA estimates

📁 **File Management**
   Before/after photos auto-uploaded per job
   All permits, invoices, and warranties in one place
   Property-specific folders organized by address

💻 **Terminal-Style Communication**
   Log entries for every action taken
   Transparent audit trail — who did what, when
   One-click export for owner reports

```

**This isn't just email — this is full operational control.**

We handle everything under one roof:
- Kitchen & bathroom renovations
- Epoxy flooring & coatings
- Handyman services (the 50 little things)
- Roofing repairs & gutter guards
- Storm prep & seasonal maintenance

**Worth a 10-minute demo?** I can show you how the dashboard works and walk through our tiered maintenance packages.

One vendor. One invoice. One point of contact. Total control.
```

**Visual Assets to Include:**
1. Dashboard screenshot (Swarm Monitor window)
2. Task tracking visualization
3. Before/after photo gallery link
4. Testimonial carousel (3 PM clients)

**Objection Pre-Handlers:**
- "We already have contractors" → That's why PMs switch to us. Dashboard coordination + single vendor vs. 5 unreliable subs.
- "We use property management software" → Our dashboard integrates with your software. We feed in; you manage out.
- "Too expensive" → Our tiered packages scale with unit count. Start with 1 property, expand as needed.

## Template 2: Apartment Complex — Mission Log Edition

**Subject:** `[Complex Name] — Your Maintenance Mission Log`

```
Hey [First Name],

Managing [X] units means something is always breaking. Most PMs track it with:
- Excel sheets that nobody updates
- Voicemails that get lost
- Sticky notes that fall behind the desk

**We track it with a Mission Log.**

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗

**KMJK provides:**

✓ **Unit Turnovers** — kitchen/bath refresh in 5-7 days
✓ **Epoxy Coatings** — garage floors, laundry rooms, common areas
✓ **Handyman On-Call** — same-week response for tenant requests
✓ **Roofing & Gutters** — preventive maintenance before storm season
✓ **Seasonal Packages** — storm prep, pressure washing, exterior touch-ups

**Every job logged. Every update tracked. Every photo uploaded.**

You don't call us to ask "what's happening?" — you open the dashboard and see it.

**Want a live demo of your complex's mission log?**

We don't just fix it. We track it, log it, and report it.
```

**Visual Assets to Include:**
1. Mission Log window screenshot
2. Weekly task completion graph
3. Before/after photo carousel (unit turnovers)
4. "This Week at Your Property" sample report

**Objection Pre-Handlers:**
- "Our tenants don't care about dashboards" → They care about fast fixes. Dashboard = 2.3 day avg response time.
- "This seems like overkill for our size" → Scales to any size. Start with basic task tracking, expand as needed.
- "Do we need to install anything?" → No. Cloud dashboard, accessible from any device.

## Template 3: Auto Shop — Epoxy Focus Edition

**Subject:** `[Shop Name] — Floors That Pay for Themselves`

```
Hey [First Name],

Your service bay floors take a beating. Oil, chemicals, tire marks, daily abuse — and customers notice.

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗

║ • Clean, uniform surface = "pros here"       ║
║ • Oil wipes right off                         ║
║ • Chemical-resistant = safe for heavy duty     ║
║ • Daily cleaning = 5 minutes with mop       ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ 💰 ROI CALCULATION:                         ║

1. Before/after gallery (10+ photos)
2. ROI calculation graph (18-month payback)
3. Process timeline (Friday PM → Sunday PM → Monday open)

- "How much?" → Varies by size. Free quote in 24 hours.
- "Will it lift with hot tires?" → We use high-temp epoxy. Lifts at 350°F+. Hot tires = 200°F max.

## Template 4: Restaurant — Commercial Kitchen Edition

**Subject:** `[Restaurant Name] — Kitchen Built for 10 Years or 10 Weeks?`

```
Hi [First Name],

Commercial kitchens get destroyed. Grease, water, heavy equipment, health inspectors — everything breaks faster.

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ 🍽️ KITCHEN AUDIT — [Restaurant Name]         ║

║ 🚩 Grease traps (overflow risk)              ║
║ 🚩 Backsplash gaps (mold risk)               ║
║ 🚩 Leaking faucets (water damage)           ║
╠════════════════════════════════════════════╣

║ ✅ Plumbing upgrades (preventative)          ║
║ ✅ Full kitchen gut (when it's time)         ║

║ • Start Saturday → open Monday               ║
║ • Work around your hours                    ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

**We know what inspectors flag. We fix to code first time.**

We've renovated kitchens from Stuart to Fort Pierce:
- Epoxy flooring (non-slip, chemical-resistant)
- Stainless steel backsplash & countertops
- Plumbing fixture upgrades (grease trap to faucet)
- Full kitchen gut-and-rebuild

**Health department breathing down your neck?** We're already on it.

**Worth a quick scope?** Even if you're not ready now, we'll have numbers when budget opens.

```

**Visual Assets to Include:**
1. Health inspector flag checklist (before/after)
2. Kitchen gallery (before/after photos)
3. Installation timeline graphic
4. "Passed Inspection" certificate sample

**Objection Pre-Handlers:**
- "Health department is on us about X" → That's our bread and butter. We know exactly what inspectors flag and fix to code first time.
- "Can we stay open during renovation?" → Partial renovation yes, full gut no. We work nights/Sundays.
- "How much does this cost?" → Depends on scope. Free quote in 24 hours.

## Template 5: HOA / COA — Community Management Edition

**Subject:** `[HOA Name] — One Vendor for 100 Properties`

```
Dear [HOA Name] Board,

Managing [X] properties means coordinating [Y] different contractors for:
- Roofing repairs
- Gutter installation
- Epoxy driveways and pool decks
- Common area maintenance
- Emergency repairs

**Or... one vendor for all of it.**

**Visual Assets to Include:**
1. Community dashboard screenshot
2. Phase progress visualization
3. Before/after gallery (pool decks, driveways)
4. Monthly report sample

**Objection Pre-Handlers:**
- "We have a maintenance company" → Are they one vendor or a network? If it's one, we can still bid on epoxy/roofing. If it's a network, ask about reliability.
- "Our board meets quarterly" → We'll prepare quarterly reports showing ROI, job completion, and resident satisfaction.
- "This is expensive" → Compare our quarterly invoice to your current vendor invoices. We usually save 20-30%.
