## 🎯 UPDATED STRATEGY (CHRIS DIRECTION)

**PRIMARY FOCUS: Treasure Coast FIRST (radiating out)**

**Treasure Coast (FL):**
- Stuart (Josue's home base)
- Jensen Beach
- Port St. Lucie
- Vero Beach
- Sebastian

**THEN:**
- Other 14 high-income metros (San Jose, SF, Boston, etc.)

---

## 📊 REALISTIC CAPACITY (36 HOURS)

**Concurrency Rules:**
- 15-17 agents max (safe)
- 20+ triggers cooldown
- Rate limits: 15-min reset

**Wave Schedule:**
- **Wave 1 (now - 12:00 UTC):** 7 agents (enrichment)
- **Wave 2 (12:00 - 18:00):** 7 agents (next metro)
- **Wave 3 (18:00 - 00:00):** 7 agents (next metro)
- **Wave 4 (00:00 - 06:00):** 7 agents (next metro)
- **Wave 5 (06:00 - 12:00):** 7 agents (final push)

**Expected Output:**
- 5 enrichment agents × 6 hours = 100+ leads/metro
- 5 metros × 100 = **500-600 verified leads** (realistic)
- PLUS: Scrapers running 24/7 = thousands of raw leads

---

## ✅ RULES

1. **Adding, NOT replacing** — Keep all scrapers running
2. **Don't stop other jobs** — Job Board, Craigslist, Directory continue
3. **Treasure Coast FIRST** — Then radiate out
4. **Quality > quantity** — 100 verified > 10,000 scraped
5. **Track ALL errors** — Fix them, guide agents
