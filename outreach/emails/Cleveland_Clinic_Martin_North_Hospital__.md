Hi there,

I came across Cleveland Clinic Martin North Hospital - Medicare while looking at healthcare businesses in Stuart and wanted to reach out.

Need compliant, sanitary flooring that doesn't disrupt patient care

Medical-grade epoxy, antimicrobial coatings, ADA-compliant, phased installation

Would you be open to a quick 5-minute call?

Best,
Chris
