- **Per Unit:** $677/unit/month (22 units)
- **Hours/Week:** 32 hours pooled facilities labor
- **Includes:**

## 📋 THE 20-SECOND PITCH SCRIPT (Verbatim)

*"For $14,900/mo (Standard), we handle facilities & landscaping to keep you stable. It allows for slow improvements, but maintenance comes first.

For $19,200/mo (Premium), we shift gears. We bring in extra capacity to handle the daily grind, freeing us up to run a **Phased Renovation Plan**.

First 90 days, we stabilize the property. Then, we set a 'Renovation Velocity' based on the stabilized pool. If we have a light maintenance week, we renovate faster. If it's heavy, we slow down. Your bill stays exactly the same ($19,200)."*

## 🎯 OBJECTIONS + CLEAN REPLIES

| Owner Objection | Clean Reply |
|----------------|-------------|
| *"Can you renovate a unit a month?"* | *"Maybe, but we won't promise that until after the 90-day stabilization. We'll phase it in. The goal is consistent progress without blowing the budget."* |
| *"Why not just stick with Standard?"* | *"You can. But Standard is mostly reactive. You'll get renovations done, but much slower. Premium buys us manpower to actually focus on upgrades."* |
| *"I don't want surprise costs."* | *"That's why you pay a flat subscription. If renovations take longer because of maintenance issues, you don't pay extra—it just takes a bit more time."* |
| *"Why separate turnovers?"* | *"Turns are vacancy-driven and volatile. Flat-rate turns keep it fair and transparent."* |
| *"What about storms?"* | *"Storm services are optional and priced clearly—prep, shutters, and post-storm assessment."* |

## 🔄 THE "STABILIZE & RENOVATE" STRATEGY (Premium Tier)

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Months 1-3)
- **Goal:** Learn the building, fix critical issues, determine "Renovation Velocity"
- **Action:** Focus on maintenance, identify patterns, establish baseline

### Phase 2: Phased Upgrades (Month 4+)
- **Goal:** Lock in renovation plan (flooring, fixtures) that fits weekly hour budget
- **Strategy:** Variable speed, fixed cost
  - If maintenance is light → renovation speeds up
  - If maintenance is heavy → renovation slows down
  - Your bill stays exactly the same ($19,200)
- **Priority:** Premium projects always skip the queue

## 📦 WHAT'S BILLED SEPARATELY

- **Unit turnovers / make-ready:** Standard Turn $1,200/unit | Heavy Turn (quoted)
- **Materials:** 20% markup on cost; owner approval required over $250 (unless emergency/mitigation)
- **Capital remodels / large renovations:** Quoted separately unless approved from pool
- **Work above weekly pool:** Approved and scoped in advance unless emergency/mitigation
- **Optional add-ons:** Storm prep, HVAC protection, plumbing risk control, electrical scanning, exterior wash, renovation support

## 🚨 RECOMMENDED PRICING LOGIC

**Standard Tier ($14,900/month, 32 hrs/week):**
- **"Middle Mediocrity" Capacity Call:** Without records, professional underwriting for vintage FL multifamily usually lands around 30–45 hrs/week to stay stable.
- **32 hrs/week is conservative-but-not-worst-case** starting point that:
  - Covers ongoing tickets
  - Keeps preventive work happening
  - Avoids "full-time tech" pricing shock

**Premium Tier ($19,200/month, 60 hrs/week):**
- **"Growth Engine":** Allows us to offload basic tasks and focus hours on renovations you actually want.
- **Renovation Subscription:** Maintenance + funds your upgrade cycle (variable speed, fixed cost).
