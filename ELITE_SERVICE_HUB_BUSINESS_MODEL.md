## 🤔 DECISIONS NEEDED

### Clarify with Chris:
1. **Instantly Pricing:** How much for email warming? (was thinking $30/mo)
2. **Token Scaling:** When do we scale to 7B or 14B tokens?
3. **Buyout Terms:** Is $20,000 correct for website + CRM buyout?
4. **Contract:** Please send Josue's property maintenance contract from KMJK repository

### Update When Decided:
1. **Add Instantly cost** to monthly fixed costs
2. **Set token scaling triggers** (when to add 3B or 10B tokens)
3. **Confirm buyout price** ($20,000 for website + CRM)
4. **Add property maintenance contract** to documentation

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Next 48 Hours):
1. Review Josue's contract (when Chris sends)
2. Confirm Instantly pricing for email warming
3. Set token scaling triggers (when to add 3B/10B tokens)
4. Create spreadsheet template for cost/profit tracking
5. Update all documents with correct costs ($35/month, not $180)

### After Clarification:
1. Build automated cost tracking system (CSV or database)
2. Integrate with war room dashboard (real-time profit metrics)
3. Update financial projections with confirmed costs
4. Set scaling triggers for tokens + email infrastructure
