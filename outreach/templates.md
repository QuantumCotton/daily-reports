## Template 1: Property Management Company
**Use when:** Lead is a property management company, HOA manager, or multi-unit operator
**Subject line formula:** `[Company] + KMJK = Zero Maintenance Headaches`

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s maintenance setup

Hey [First Name],

I came across [Company Name] and wanted to reach out. We work with property managers across the Treasure Coast who are tired of juggling 5 different contractors for basic maintenance.

KMJK handles it all under one roof:
- Kitchen & bathroom renovations (full gut to cosmetic refresh)
- Epoxy flooring & coatings (garages, common areas, pool decks)
- Handyman services (the 50 little things tenants call about)
- Roofing repairs & gutter guards
- Storm prep & seasonal maintenance

We're based in Jensen Beach and already service properties from Stuart to Vero Beach. Most of our property management clients start with a single unit test — zero risk, and you'll see the difference.

Would a 10-minute call this week make sense? Happy to walk through our tiered maintenance packages.

**Objection pre-handler:** "We already have contractors" → That's exactly why PMs switch to us. One vendor, one invoice, one point of contact instead of 5 unreliable subs.

## Template 2: Apartment Complex / Multi-Unit
**Use when:** Lead is an apartment complex, condo association, or multi-unit building
**Subject line formula:** `[X] Units Deserve Better Than Band-Aid Fixes`

```
Subject: Maintenance solution for [Complex Name]

Hi [First Name],

Managing [X] units means something always needs fixing. We get it — that's literally all we do.

KMJK provides full-service property maintenance for complexes on the Treasure Coast:

✓ Unit turnovers — kitchen/bath refresh in 5-7 days
✓ Epoxy coatings — garage floors, laundry rooms, common areas
✓ Handyman on-call — same-week response for tenant requests
✓ Roofing & gutters — preventive maintenance before storm season
✓ Seasonal packages — storm prep, pressure washing, exterior touch-ups

We're not a franchise. Josue runs every job personally. That means you get the owner on-site, not a random sub who ghosts you.

We put together custom maintenance packages based on unit count. What does your maintenance situation look like right now?

**Objection pre-handler:** "Send pricing" → Our packages are custom per property. A quick 10-min walkthrough call saves everyone time vs. back-and-forth emails.

## Template 3: Auto Shop / Dealership (Epoxy Focus)
**Use when:** Lead is an auto body shop, dealership, mechanic, or car wash
**Subject line formula:** `Your Shop Floor Is Costing You Customers`

```
Subject: Quick thought about [Shop Name]'s floor

Hey [First Name],

Walked past [Shop Name] the other day (or saw your listing online) and had a thought — your service bay floors take a beating, and a pro epoxy coating pays for itself in 2 ways:

1. Customer perception — clean floors = "these guys care about details"
2. Maintenance savings — epoxy resists oil, chemicals, and tire marks. Mop and done.

We coat auto shop floors across the Treasure Coast. Most shops do it over a weekend so there's zero downtime. We handle surface prep, crack repair, and a commercial-grade epoxy system that holds up to lifts, jacks, and daily abuse.

Want a quick quote? I can come measure and have numbers to you same day.

**Objection pre-handler:** "How long does it take?" → Most shop floors are done in 2-3 days. We schedule around your hours.

## Template 4: Restaurant / Commercial Kitchen
**Use when:** Lead is a restaurant, commercial kitchen, catering company, or food service
**Subject line formula:** `[Restaurant] Kitchen — Built to Last or Band-Aid'd Together?`

```
Subject: Kitchen renovation question for [Restaurant Name]

Hi [First Name],

Commercial kitchens get destroyed. Between grease, water, heavy equipment, and health inspectors, everything breaks faster than in a normal building.

We renovate commercial kitchens specifically for durability:
- Non-slip epoxy flooring (health code compliant, easy to clean)
- Stainless steel backsplash & countertop installation
- Plumbing fixture upgrades (grease trap to faucet)
- Full kitchen gut-and-rebuild when it's time

We're local (Jensen Beach) and we've renovated kitchens for restaurants from Stuart to Fort Pierce. We work around your service hours — most jobs happen overnight or during your slow days.

Worth a quick conversation? Even if you're not ready now, we can scope it so you have a number when budget opens up.

**Objection pre-handler:** "Health department is on us about X" → That's our bread and butter. We know exactly what inspectors flag and fix to code the first time.

## Template 5: Real Estate Investor / Flipper
**Use when:** Lead is a real estate investor, house flipper, or buy-and-hold landlord
**Subject line formula:** `Your Next Flip — Done Right, On Budget, On Time`

```
Subject: Renovation partner for your Treasure Coast properties

Hey [First Name],

If you're flipping or holding properties on the Treasure Coast, you need a contractor who:
- Shows up when they say they will
- Doesn't nickel-and-dime you with change orders
- Does kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, AND punch-list items — not just one trade

That's us. KMJK handles full property renovations for investors from Stuart to Vero Beach. Kitchens, bathrooms, epoxy garages, roofing, handyman punch lists — all one crew, one invoice.

Most investors we work with started with one property to test us out. After that, we become their go-to for every deal.

Got a property in the pipeline? Let's talk scope and numbers.

**Objection pre-handler:** "What's your per-sq-ft rate?" → Depends on scope. We price per project, not per foot, because every property is different. Quick call gets you an accurate number.

## Template 6: Cleaning Company (Partnership)
**Use when:** Lead is a commercial or residential cleaning company
**Subject line formula:** `Referral Partnership — You Clean, We Fix`

```
Subject: Partnership idea for [Company Name]

Hey [First Name],

Your cleaners are inside properties every week. They see things that need fixing — cracked tile, worn-out cabinets, damaged flooring, leaky fixtures. Right now those observations die on the vine.

Here's the idea: you refer maintenance & renovation needs to us, we handle the work, and we send referral fees your way. No extra work for your team. Just pass along the lead.

What we handle:
- Kitchen & bathroom renovations
- Epoxy flooring & coatings
- Handyman repairs (everything your cleaners notice but can't fix)
- Roofing & gutter maintenance

We're KMJK Group, based in Jensen Beach. We already work with property managers and investors across the Treasure Coast.

```

**Objection pre-handler:** "How much is the referral fee?" → We structure it per deal. Typically $100-500 per closed referral depending on job size. Zero risk on your end.

## Template 7: Warehouse / Industrial
**Use when:** Lead is a warehouse, distribution center, or industrial facility
**Subject line formula:** `Your Warehouse Floor Is a Liability — Here's the Fix`

```
Subject: Floor coating for [Company Name]'s facility

Hey [First Name],

Bare concrete warehouse floors crack, dust, stain, and become slip hazards. A commercial epoxy system fixes all four problems for 10+ years.

We coat warehouse and industrial floors across the Treasure Coast:
- High-traffic epoxy systems rated for forklifts and pallet jacks
- Chemical-resistant coatings for manufacturing areas
- Line striping for safety zones, loading areas, and walkways
- Crack repair and surface prep included

Most warehouse jobs are done over a weekend. We measure, prep, coat, and you're back to full operations Monday morning.

## Template 8: Mobile Detailing / Fleet Service
**Use when:** Lead is a mobile detailing company, fleet operator, or car wash
**Subject line formula:** `Your Detail Bay Deserves a Real Floor`

```
Subject: Epoxy floor for [Company Name]

Hey [First Name],

Detailing bays and wash areas take constant water, chemicals, and tire traffic. Standard concrete can't handle it — it cracks, stains, and gets slippery.

We install commercial-grade epoxy and polyaspartic coatings specifically for:
- Detail bays and wash bays (non-slip, chemical resistant)
- Shop floors (oil and solvent resistant)
- Customer-facing areas (show-quality metallic finishes)

Based in Jensen Beach, serving the whole Treasure Coast. Most detail shop floors are done in 2-3 days.

## Template 9: Roofing Lead (Homeowner or Commercial)
**Use when:** Lead found searching for roofing services or storm damage repair
**Subject line formula:** `Roof Check Before Storm Season — Free Inspection`

```
Subject: Free roof inspection for [Address/Area]

Hi [First Name],

Storm season is coming and the Treasure Coast gets hit hard. A small roof leak now becomes a $20K insurance headache in September.

KMJK offers free roof inspections for homeowners and businesses from Stuart to Vero Beach:
- Full roof condition assessment
- Photo documentation of any issues
- Written estimate if repairs are needed
- Gutter guard installation to prevent future debris damage

We're not a sales team with a clipboard — Josue personally inspects every roof and gives you an honest assessment. If your roof is fine, we'll tell you.

## Template 10: Handyman / General Maintenance
**Use when:** Lead is a homeowner, small business, or property with general maintenance needs
**Subject line formula:** `The Handyman Who Actually Shows Up`

```
Subject: Reliable handyman service in [City]

Hey [First Name],

Finding a handyman who actually shows up, does quality work, and doesn't ghost you after the first job is basically impossible on the Treasure Coast. We hear it every week.

KMJK handles all the stuff that falls between "too small for a general contractor" and "too important to ignore":
- Drywall repair, painting, trim work
- Fixture installs (fans, lights, faucets, toilets)
- Door and window repairs
- Deck and patio maintenance
- TV mounting, shelf installation
- Small tile and flooring repairs
- And the 100 other things on your list

We're based in Jensen Beach and service Stuart to Vero Beach. Same-week scheduling for most jobs.

Got a list? Send it over and we'll quote the whole thing at once.

## Template 11: HOA / Condo Association
**Use when:** Lead is an HOA board, condo association, or community management company
**Subject line formula:** `[Community Name] Maintenance — One Vendor, Zero Drama`

```
Subject: Maintenance vendor proposal for [Community Name]

Hi [First Name],

HOA boards deal with enough drama without adding unreliable contractors to the mix. We work with communities across the Treasure Coast as a single-source maintenance vendor.

What that means for your board:
- ONE vendor for renovations, repairs, coatings, roofing, and handyman work
- ONE point of contact (Josue, the owner — not a call center)
- ONE invoice per month (makes treasurer happy)
- Photo documentation of all completed work (makes board happy)

Current HOA services:
✓ Common area renovations (clubhouse, pool area, lobbies)
✓ Epoxy coating for parking garages and walkways
✓ Unit-level maintenance for individual owners
✓ Roofing & gutter maintenance
✓ Storm prep and emergency response
✓ Seasonal exterior maintenance

We put together custom annual maintenance proposals based on community size and needs. Happy to present at your next board meeting.

## Template 12: Gutter Guard / Exterior Maintenance
**Use when:** Lead found searching for gutter services, pressure washing, or exterior maintenance
**Subject line formula:** `Stop Cleaning Gutters — Permanent Fix for [Address/Area]`

```
Subject: Gutter guard installation in [City]

Hi [First Name],

Climbing a ladder to clean gutters 4 times a year is dangerous, expensive, and completely preventable.

KMJK installs commercial-grade gutter guard systems that eliminate gutter cleaning permanently:
- Micro-mesh guards that block everything (leaves, pine needles, seed pods)
- Professional installation — we don't just snap-on big box store screens
- Lifetime warranty on materials
- Full gutter cleaning included before installation

While we're up there, we also handle:
- Gutter repair and replacement
- Fascia board repair
- Roof inspection (free with any gutter job)
- Pressure washing (roof, driveway, siding)

Based in Jensen Beach, serving Stuart to Vero Beach.

Want a quote? Quick measurement and you'll have numbers same day.
