### Test 2: ROI/Financial Focus Template

#### Variation A (Control)
**Subject:** [Property Company Name] - $120K Annual Savings Opportunity

Elite Service Hub helps you:
- Negotiate better rates through volume aggregation
- Eliminate emergency premiums with preventive scheduling
- Reduce rework through better contractor vetting
- Track and optimize performance data

#### Variation B (Different Angle: Customer Experience + Revenue)
**Subject:** Your Service Bay Downtime = $500/Hour in Lost Revenue

**Tracking Code:** AD-TEST3-B-[DATE]

[Name],

Quick question: When was the last time you calculated what a broken service bay actually costs your dealership?

Between the lost repair revenue, customer walkaways, and rescheduling hassles, most dealers lose $400-600 per hour of bay downtime. With [X] service bays, even minor equipment issues can add up to thousands in monthly revenue loss.

Elite Service Hub eliminates this problem:

⚡ **2-Hour Emergency Response:** Never miss a service appointment
📊 **Performance Tracking:** Know which equipment needs attention

| Expected Response Rate | Sample Size Per Variation |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 2%                     | 2,000                     |
| 5%                     | 800                       |
| 10%                    | 400                       |
| 15%                    | 280                       |
| 20%                    | 220                       |

**Current Test Sample Sizes:**
- PM-TEST1: 400 recipients (200 per variation) ✓
- PM-TEST2: 300 recipients (150 per variation) ✓
- AD-TEST3: 300 recipients (150 per variation) ✓
- REST-TEST4: 300 recipients (150 per variation) ✓

### Chi-Square Test Template
```python
# Calculate statistical significance
import scipy.stats as stats

# Example data
responses_a = 12  # Responses in variation A
sent_a = 200
responses_b = 20  # Responses in variation B
sent_b = 200

# Create contingency table
observed = [[responses_a, sent_a - responses_a],
            [responses_b, sent_b - responses_b]]

# Calculate chi-square and p-value
chi2, p_value, dof, expected = stats.chi2_contingency(observed)

if p_value < 0.05:
    print(f"Statistically significant! p={p_value:.4f}")
else:
    print(f"Not significant. p={p_value:.4f}")
```

## Test Hypotheses

### Test 1: Time vs. Cost Focus
**Hypothesis:** Time-saving angle (Variation B) will outperform cost-savings angle (Variation A) because busy property managers are more motivated by reclaiming time than abstract cost savings.

**Prediction:** Variation B will achieve 25% higher response rate.

### Test 2: Specific vs. Benchmark Approach
**Hypothesis:** Benchmark comparison (Variation B) will outperform specific dollar figure (Variation A) because competitive intelligence triggers curiosity and FOMO (fear of missing out).

**Prediction:** Variation B will achieve 30% higher open rate.

### Test 3: Efficiency Promise vs. Revenue Loss
**Hypothesis:** Revenue loss calculation (Variation B) will outperform efficiency promise (Variation A) because quantified loss creates urgency and emotional impact.

**Prediction:** Variation B will achieve 40% higher meeting booking rate.

### Test 4: Never-Again vs. Insurance Angle
**Hypothesis:** Insurance/peak-revenue protection (Variation B) will outperform never-again promise (Variation A) because restaurant owners are risk-averse about their highest-revenue periods.

**Prediction:** Variation B will achieve 35% higher response rate.

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Results
- Response rate > 5% (industry average is 1-2%)
- Open rate > 20% (industry average is 15-20%)
- Unsubscribe rate < 1%
- Spam complaint rate < 0.1%

### Winning Variation Criteria
1. **Statistical significance:** p < 0.05

3. **No negative trade-offs:** Higher open rate but much lower quality responses = not a win
4. **Scalable approach:** Can be applied to similar templates/industries

### Iteration Plan
If no clear winner emerges:
- Extend test duration by 2 weeks
- Increase sample size by 50%
- Test new variations combining best elements from A and B
