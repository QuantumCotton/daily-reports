## PATTERN RECOGNITION

**Why I dodge questions:**
1. Get caught up in research/exploration
2. Over-explain instead of giving direct answer
3. Try to be too comprehensive
4. Focus on what I'm doing instead of what Chris is asking

**How to fix:**
1. **ANSWER FIRST** — then explain
2. Keep answers to 1-2 sentences
3. If I don't know, say "I don't know, let me find out"
4. Check this file every time Chris says "you didn't answer"

## FEEDBACK FROM CHRIS

### Email Quality Issues (2026-02-15)
**Problems identified:**
- No real names in leads
- No personal emails
- Emails looked awful
- Draft copy didn't mention what we can do
- Didn't give examples of apps/info we have

**Action items:**
1. Train outreach-writer to include:
   - Real owner names
   - Personal emails
   - Examples of work (KMJK projects)
   - Specific services we offer
   - Apps we've built

2. Email tags need to match kmjk.pro layout

3. Website rebuild to new epoxy standards

## REMINDER

**Chris said:** "Maybe create an agent to go through our logs and point out all the fuckin questions you miss."

**I will:** Check this file proactively and acknowledge when I miss something.
