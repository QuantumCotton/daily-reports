## Epoxy Capability Tiers

### Phase 1 (NOW): Optus Resin Products
- Using Optus Resin Technology (Warminster, PA) professional products
- Products: OptiFlake (decorative flake), Floaterra (self-leveling), Resicote SF (chemical-resistant), AquaMAX (pool)
- Dealer pricing: $78-150/gal formulated
- Phone: 1-833-466-7887
- Good for: building portfolio, first 3-5 jobs, learning application at scale

### Phase 2 (Month 2-3): Hybrid Custom
- Buying BPA resin in 55-gal drums ($25-35/gal raw)
- Custom formulating primer + base coats
- Still using Optus polyaspartic for topcoats
- Equipment budget: ~$2,400 one-time (drum dollies, pumps, heaters, drills, paddles)
- Saves 30-40% on materials vs full Optus

### Phase 3 (Month 4+): Full Vertical Integration
- Novolac resin + 3M Ceramic Microspheres + custom Polyaspartic topcoat
- Raw material cost: $0.95/sq ft (vs $2.50/sq ft Optus)
- Performance: 500F heat, Shore D 90+, Taber 4-8mg, 20-year UV
- Market as proprietary Ceramic-Novolac technology

## Pricing Guide (What We Charge Clients)
- Residential garage (2K sf): $5-8/sf = $10K-16K

- Bucket Brigade: 3-person continuous flow to prevent flash cure exotherm
- Ceramic microspheres (3M W-610): Compressive strength, displaces resin volume, lowers cost
