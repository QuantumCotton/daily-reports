# Voicemail Playbook

## Best Practices for Voicemail Success

### Timing Matters
- **Best times to call:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings (too busy), Friday afternoons (checked out), lunch hours
- **Voicemail pickup rates:** 40-60% depending on industry

### Script Structure
1. **Greeting (2-3 sec):** Professional, friendly
2. **Who you are (3-5 sec):** Name + company
3. **The hook (5-8 sec):** Why you're calling, show research
4. **Value proposition (15-20 sec):** Benefits, not features
5. **Social proof (5-8 sec):** Numbers, percentages, results
6. **Call-to-action (3-5 sec):** Clear, single action
7. **Phone number (2-3 sec):** Slow and clear

### Delivery Tips

#### Voice & Tone
- Speak at a conversational pace (not too fast, not too slow)
- Use upward inflection on questions
- Pause briefly at commas and periods
- Smile while talking – it comes through in your voice
- Avoid sounding scripted or robotic

#### Phone Number Protocol
- **ALWAYS** say your phone number at the end
- Say it **twice** if it's a callback line
- Speak slowly: "5-5-5... 1-2-3... 4-5-6-7"
- Consider area code even if local

### Industry-Specific Adjustments

#### Property Managers
- Emphasize numbers: vacancy rates, renewal rates, cost savings
- Focus on operational efficiency and tenant satisfaction
- Mention specific property metrics when possible
- Appeal to both financial and operational pain points

#### Auto Dealers
- Be energetic and confident
- Focus on results: appointments, sales, inventory turnover
- Use automotive industry language appropriately
- Emphasize speed and competitive advantage

#### Restaurants
- Warm, friendly tone
- Focus on revenue and customer experience
- Mention industry challenges (margins, competition)
- Appeal to both profit and passion for food

### Follow-Up Strategy

#### Day 1: Initial Voicemail
- Leave script from above
- Log call in CRM with timestamp

#### Day 3: Second Voicemail
- Reference first call
- Offer additional value (case study, demo, toolkit)
- Different angle on same value proposition

#### Day 7: Final Voicemail
- Acknowledge they're busy
- Leave door open for future
- Provide alternative contact method (email)

### Metrics to Track
- Voicemail pickup rate
- Callback percentage
- Time to callback
- Conversion rate from callbacks
- Cost per voicemail-delivered lead

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Leave voicemails longer than 45 seconds
- Sound scripted or monotone
- Talk about features instead of benefits
- Forget to leave your phone number
- Call too frequently (appears desperate)
- Leave vague messages with no clear CTA

✅ **Do:**
- Personalize with their name when possible
- Mention something specific about their business
- Use social proof (numbers, results)
- Keep it conversational
- Leave one clear next step
- Call with energy and confidence

### Sample Daily Workflow

```
9:00-9:15   Review target list, prepare notes
9:15-10:00  First wave of calls (property managers)
10:00-10:15  Document results, prepare for next batch
10:15-11:00  Second wave (auto dealers)
11:00-11:15  Break, review metrics
2:00-3:00    Third wave (restaurants)
3:00-3:30    Follow-up calls from callbacks
3:30-4:00    Document day's results, plan tomorrow
```

### CRM Integration
- Log every voicemail with timestamp and script used
- Note any responses or callbacks
- Track which scripts perform best by industry
- Tag leads by interest level and follow-up timeline
