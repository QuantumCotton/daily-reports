# Objection Handling Guide
## Outreach Scripts for Common Objections

---

## Objection 1: "We already have a contractor"

### Acknowledge and Validate
"That's great to hear! It's always smart to have someone reliable handling your projects. Most of our best clients started out with a contractor they liked before they switched to us."

### Pivot to Value Prop
"I'm not asking you to replace them tomorrow. Here's what we've found: even good contractors get busy, take vacation, or don't have expertise in every niche area. Think of us as your backup or second opinion—someone you can call when:
- Your current guy is booked out
- You need specialty work they don't handle
- You want a competitive quote for comparison
- You need faster turnaround than they can offer"

### Offer Alternative
"How about this: I'll send you our portfolio and pricing so you have us as a backup option. No pressure, no sales pitch—just keeping you in your Rolodex for when you need us. When would that be useful?"

### Call-to-Action
"Mind if I send over a one-pager with our services and contact info? Takes 30 seconds to review, and you'll have it for the future. I'll also include our emergency contact number—we prioritize existing clients first."

## Objection 2: "Your pricing is too high"

### Acknowledge and Validate
"I hear that a lot, and I completely understand. Budget matters, and you want to make sure every dollar works hard for you."

### Pivot to Value Prop
"Let me share what's actually included in that price:
- **Done-right guarantee**: We fix anything that's not to your standard at no cost
- **No hidden fees**: What we quote is what you pay—no surprise add-ons
- **Insurance & licensing**: Full coverage (we've seen the horror stories when contractors cut corners)
- **Faster completion**: We finish projects 20-30% faster because we're not juggling 10 jobs at once
- **Project management**: You get a dedicated point of contact, status updates, and timeline tracking"

### Offer Alternative
"If the full package is outside your budget right now, we have two options:
1. **Scope adjustment**: We can phase the project or prioritize the highest-impact items first
2. **Budget-friendly tier**: We offer a standard service package with faster turnaround for smaller projects"

### Call-to-Action
"Would you be open to a 10-minute call where I walk through exactly what you get for the investment? No commitment—we'll just break down the numbers so you can compare apples to apples. Even if you don't choose us, you'll know what to look for in other quotes."

## Objection 3: "Not interested right now"

### Acknowledge and Validate
"Totally fair. Timing is everything, and I don't want to be a pest if now isn't the right moment."

### Pivot to Value Prop
"Quick question—when you DO think about [specific service they need], what will be the trigger? Is it:
- An upcoming project or renovation?
- A current contractor leaving or being unreliable?
- Budget opening up in the next quarter?
- Something breaking that needs immediate attention?"

### Offer Alternative
"If you don't mind, let me send you a brief overview of what we do. Takes 2 minutes to skim, and when the timing IS right, you'll have our info handy. I promise not to follow up incessantly—I'll drop you a note in 60 days to see if anything changed."

### Call-to-Action
"What's the best email for that one-pager? And realistically, when do you think you might be looking at [service] again? Even a rough timeframe helps me know when to check in—or when to leave you alone until you reach out."

## Objection 4: "Send me more info"

### Acknowledge and Validate
"Absolutely! I'm happy to share more details. I know you probably get a lot of vendor emails, so I'll make this worth your time."

### Pivot to Value Prop
"Before I send everything over, let me ask: what's most important to you right now?
- **Proof of results**: Case studies, testimonials, before/after photos?
- **Technical specs**: Our process, materials, timeline?
- **Pricing**: Packages, payment terms, what's included?
- **Emergency response**: How quickly we can mobilize if something breaks?

I'll tailor what I send so you don't have to wade through irrelevant stuff."

### Offer Alternative
"I can send you:
1. A 1-page summary with our top 3 benefits (if you're skimming)
2. A full portfolio with case studies (if you're detail-oriented)
3. A pricing sheet with package options (if you're budgeting right now)
4. Our calendar link (if you'd rather just book a 15-min chat)"

### Call-to-Action
"Which of those would be most helpful? I'll send it over within the hour, and I'll add a note to follow up next week if you have questions. No pressure—just want to make sure you have what you need to make an informed decision."

## Objection 5: "Call me back in 6 months"

### Acknowledge and Validate
"Got it—6 months it is. I'll make a note of that and respect your timeline."

### Pivot to Value Prop
"Before I set that reminder, let me ask: what's happening in 6 months that makes that the right time? Is it:
- A project you're already planning?
- Contract renewal with your current provider?
- Budget cycle opening up?
- Something seasonal or related to your business cycle?"

### Offer Alternative
"If it's a specific project or renewal, would it help if I:
- Send you a calendar invite now for a brief check-in?
- Share what our calendar looks like in 6 months so you can book ahead?
- Provide a rough quote now that you can budget around, even if you're not ready to commit?

I'd rather over-communicate now than have you scrambling when the timing hits."

### Call-to-Action
"Let me get this right—I'll follow up on [specific date in 6 months]. Would you prefer email, text, or call? And is there anything specific you'd want me to prepare or bring to that conversation so it's worth your time?"

## Quick Reference Card

| Objection | One-Line Response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "We already have a contractor" | "Great! Think of us as your backup option for when they're booked or you need a second opinion." |
| "Your pricing is too high" | "I hear that. Our price includes a done-right guarantee, no hidden fees, and faster completion. Would a 10-minute breakdown help you compare?" |
| "Not interested right now" | "Fair enough. What's the trigger that will make you think about [service] again? I'll send info and check back then." |
| "Send me more info" | "Happy to. What's most important to you—case studies, specs, or pricing? I'll tailor it so it's actually useful." |
| "Call me back in 6 months" | "Got it. What's happening in 6 months—project, renewal, or budget? I'll note the date and check in then." |

## Tips for Delivery

1. **Listen first**: Don't interrupt. Let them finish the objection completely.
2. **Mirror back**: Repeat their concern to show you heard it ("So pricing is the main concern...").
3. **Stay curious**: Ask questions to understand the real objection (there's often a deeper one).
4. **Be authentic**: If you don't know the answer, say "Let me look into that and get back to you."
5. **End with a question**: Every script should end with a yes/no question that moves the conversation forward.

## When to Walk Away

If after handling the objection they still say "no" three times, it's time to disengage gracefully:
"I totally understand. We're not the right fit for everyone, and that's okay. I appreciate you taking the time to chat. Do you mind if I send you my contact info for the future, or would you prefer I don't follow up?"
